Consider only four gemstones for the time being. Without loss of generality, assume the values of these gemstones to be s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, s<sub>3</sub>, s<sub>4</sub>  where  s<sub>1</sub> < s<sub>2</sub> < s<sub>3</sub> < s<sub>4</sub>  . Now examine all four possible combinations of three-stone queries we can make to the magical scale:

1. **Query 2 3 4 :** Compares the second, third, and fourth gemstones.
2. **Query 1 3 4 :** Compares the first, third, and fourth gemstones.
3. **Query 1 2 4 :** Compares the first, second, and fourth gemstones.
4. **Query 1 2 3 :** Compares the first, second, and third gemstones.

The results of these queries will be :
- **First query :**  s<sub>4</sub> - s<sub>2</sub> 
- **Second query :**  s<sub>4</sub> - s<sub>1</sub> 
- **Third query :**  s<sub>4</sub> - s<sub>1</sub> 
- **Fourth query :**  s<sub>3</sub> - s<sub>1</sub> 

Observe that the queries where the gemstones not included are neither the minimum nor the maximum give same result ( s<sub>4</sub>- s<sub>1</sub> ) , and can never yield the correct answer. This generalized case is obviously still applicable when  s<sub>1</sub> = 0 .

### Strategy
1.  We consider groups of four gemstones at a time.
2. For each group, we eliminate two gemstones as impossible answers based on the query results then consider next two gemstones. When only three elements remain, we reintroduce one previously eliminated gemstone to continue the process.
3. This will ensure that at the end of this process when only two gemstones remain, one of them is guaranteed to be the CURSED GEMSTONE, as we need to guess two gemstones in the end.

If `n` is even we have made `(n-2)/2 * 4 = 2n - 4` queries else we have made `(n-3)/2 * 4  +  4 = 2n - 2` queries . If we observe the prompt given in the `nc` connection properly we can clearly see that we need to make `2n - 2` queries . So if  `n` is even, we make two random queries at the end ( which does not affect our answer ) .

A solution script implementing the same is : -

```python 
import sys
from pwn import *

def query(x, conn):
    conn.recvuntil(b">>>")
    conn.sendline(f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1] + 1} {x[2] + 1}'.encode())
    sys.stdout.flush()
    i = int(conn.recvline().decode())
    return i

def main():
    conn = remote("cursed-gemstone.ctf.pearlctf.in", 30010)
    context.log_level = "DEBUG"
    conn.recvuntil(b"forever?\n\n\n")
    n = int(conn.recvline().decode().split()[3])

    guess = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n - 1, 2):
        win = []
        curr = [guess[0], guess[1], i, i + 1]
        for j in range(4):
            x = curr[:j] + curr[j+1:]
            win.append((query(x,conn), curr[j]))
        win.sort()
        guess = [win[0][1], win[1][1]]
    
    if n % 2 == 1:
        other = 0

        while other in guess:
            other += 1
        win = []
        curr = [guess[0], guess[1], n - 1, other]
        for j in range(4):
            x = curr[:j] + curr[j+1:]
            win.append((query(x, conn), curr[j]))
        win.sort()
        guess = [win[0][1], win[1][1]]

#two random queries before guessing if n is even 
    if n % 2 == 0:
        query(x, conn)
        query(x, conn)
    
    conn.sendline(f'{guess[0] + 1} {guess[1] + 1}'.encode())
    conn.interactive()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
We get the flag `pearl{al1baba_4nd_h1s_d4mn_th13v3s}` : )
